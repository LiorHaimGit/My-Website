            Autonomous systems designer with 11+ years of experience in the field of algo engineering using Signal processing, AI Machine Learning, Estimation, Guidance and Control.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a team leader of 2 successful aerospace engineering projects, I supervised 5 engineers, mentored them, prioritized their tasks, planned strategic and tactical objectives, and provided technical and professional support.
        </p>
        <p>
            I served as the focal point for technical and professional communications within my team and between other departments. Additionally, I performed the role of Integrator for all major departments involved in these projects, with a significant emphasis on understanding the engineering aspects of each department.
